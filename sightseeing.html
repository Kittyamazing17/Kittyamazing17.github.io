          <h3>Beaches</h3>
          <p>
            Taniti is home to the most gorgeous beaches. These areas are perfect
            for setting up an umbrella, having a cool drink, and swimming in the
            crisp waters of the Pacific. There are so many to choose from that
            no one beach will ever become too crowded, even in peak season.
