          <h3>Flying</h3>
          <p>
            Most of the travlers to Taniti Island arrive by airplane. This
            airport is able to handle small jets and propeller planes. If you
            plan to come by airplane prepare to have transfers at a larger
            airport before arriving.

          <h3>Cruise Ships</h3>
          <p>
            One a week travelers may arrive on the island by cruise ship. This
            will typically drop off groups of travelers with a solid plan of
            their nights in Taniti City, but some of them are couples. If you
            plan to come by cruise ship, be prepare for the lack of return
            ships.

          <h3>Public Transportation</h3>
          <p>
            Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every
            day. Private buses serve the rest of the island. Taxis are available
            in Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented from a local rental
            agency near the airport. Bikes and helmets are available to rent
            from several vendors (helmets are required by law). Taniti City is
            fairly flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area
            surrounding Merriton Landing: this area is easy to explore on foot.
